# FaceSense

## Description:
FaceSense is a comprehensive facial recognition system developed using Python, OpenCV, and SQL. This project utilizes the face_recognition library in python, along with OpenCV and mySQL, to enable efficient face encoding, saving and matching.

## Features:
- Quick and Easy Face Encoding: FaceSense simplifies face encoding and saving from JPG images, streamlining the training of the facial recognition model by effectively encoding facial features.
- Secure Facial Feature Storage: Facial feature placement data is securely encoded and stored within the SQL database, ensuring privacy and confidentiality.
- Reliable Face Recognition: FaceSense harnesses the power of OpenCV and the face_recognition library to provide accurate face recognition capabilities, facilitating efficient and effective identification and matching of faces.
- Webcam Display with Real-time Feedback: FaceSense offers a user-friendly webcam display that showcases the real-time face recognition process, providing visual feedback by displaying recognized names associated with detected faces.

## Guidance:
